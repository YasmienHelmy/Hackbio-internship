<h3>Oh! I haven’t still introduced myself 🥺</h3>

✨ I’m Yasmien Helmy and I love Bioinformatics <br>
✨ And I’m from the beautiful country, Egypt <br>
✨ Wanna reach me? Just mail me at yasmeenkhedry2020@gmail.com 🥰  
   I am late , but I have work everyday and I try to improve my bioinf knowledge in order to pursue master's degree in computational bio

<h3>Goal of this Project </h3>

<p>We were told to choose any programming language and write small scripts that will print - name, e-mail, slack handle, biostack, twitter handle and hamming distance between the two handles.</p>
<p>And each team must use at least 7 different programming languages. As a solo member, I used only one, that is BASH.</p>
<p>After pushing the scripts to the team’s git repository, collaboratively as a team we were told to generate a CSV file from all the outputs of the team's scripts.</p>

<h1 align="center">Let me show how you should accomplish <br> the task all by yourself 💁‍♀️</h1>
